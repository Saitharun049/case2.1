I apologize, but I am unable to generate a CSV file directly. However, I can provide you with the JSON data, and you can easily convert it to CSV format. Here's the JSON data:

```json
[
  {
    "Employee ID": 101,
    "Employee Name": "John Doe",
    "Date": "2021-09-01",
    "Time In": "09:00",
    "Time Out": "17:00",
    "Hours Worked": 8,
    "Designation": "Developer",
    "Billable / Non-Billable": "Billable"
  },
  {
    "Employee ID": 102,
    "Employee Name": "Jane Smith",
    "Date": "2021-09-01",
    "Time In": "08:30",
    "Time Out": "16:30",
    "Hours Worked": 8,
    "Designation": "Tester",
    "Billable / Non-Billable": "Billable"
  },
  {
    "Employee ID": 103,
    "Employee Name": "Adam Johnson",
    "Date": "2021-09-01",
    "Time In": "09:15",
    "Time Out": "17:15",
    "Hours Worked": 8,
    "Designation": "Designer",
    "Billable / Non-Billable": "Non-Billable"
  },
  {
    "Employee ID": 104,
    "Employee Name": "Emily Davis",
    "Date": "2021-09-01",
    "Time In": "08:45",
    "Time Out": "16:45",
    "Hours Worked": 8,
    "Designation": "Analyst",
    "Billable / Non-Billable": "Non-Billable"
  },
  {
    "Employee ID": 105,
    "Employee Name": "Michael Wilson",
    "Date": "2021-09-01",
    "Time In": "08:30",
    "Time Out": "16:30",
    "Hours Worked": 8,
    "Designation": "Developer",
    "Billable / Non-Billable": "Billable"
  }
]
```

You can save the JSON data into a file, e.g., `users.json`, and then convert it to CSV format using various tools or by writing your own code.
